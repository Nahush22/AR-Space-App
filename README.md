# AR-Space-App
This is an app in which I tried in implementing the things I learnt while using Vuforia with Unity.Since I happen to also be a space geek I tried to make space related AR stuff with this app.
As of now I included 3 AR implementations:

1.A 3D model of space station displayed as an AR model.

2.A video played as an AR overlay on top of an image target.

3.A fully realised 3D model of the solar system along with planet orbits & their rotation around the sun.
